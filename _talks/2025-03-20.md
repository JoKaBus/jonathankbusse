Lattice sums in bulk systems can be written in terms of the Epstein zeta function, a generalization of the Riemann zeta function to higher dimensions. In this talk, we present to you EpsteinLib, the first high-performance library for lattice sums of this kind. Applicable for any lattice, any dimension, and any power-law interaction, it yields exact 3D sums in less than 10^(-4) seconds on a standard laptop. We discuss its application in many-body systems.
