This is my personal academic website, hosted at [jonathankbusse.com](https://jonathankbusse.com).

It is a fork of the excellent open-source project [academicpages](https://academicpages.github.io/), which provides a very pretty and easy-to-use template for academic websites built with Jekyll.

## About

I’ve kept the original formatting and structure of academicpages, while replacing the content with my own. Some unused elements were removed to simplify the site.

## Running Locally

For setup and usage instructions, please refer to the official academicpages documentation:
- [Website](https://academicpages.github.io/)
- [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io)
