Consider the following: What computable effects do particles have on each other if there are simply too many of them for computers to handle separately and if their properties are lost if "smooth them out" too much? 

This is what i am trying to find out in my PhD at the German Aerospace Center (DLR), where i specialize in numerical analysis in high-precision many-body physics. 

About me
======
When i am done crunching numbers i like to go dancing in bouldering.
I'm especially thankful for my roommates who accept me playing piano until in the evening.
If there is still time on the weekend, you may find me playing board games with my friend.
