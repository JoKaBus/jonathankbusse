**Consider the following:** What computable effects do particles have on each other if there are simply too many of them for computers to handle separately, and if their properties are lost when we "smooth them out" too much?
This is what I am trying to find out in my PhD at the German Aerospace Center (DLR), where I specialize in numerical analysis in high-precision many-body physics.

The Epstein Zeta Function
======
My research revolves around the Epstein zeta function, a special function with applications to many-body lattice systems and many exciting properties. It is a broad generalization of the famous Riemann zeta function, whose zeros are the subject of one of the Millennium Problems.

About Me
======
When I’m done crunching numbers, I like to go dancing or bouldering. I’m especially thankful for my roommates, who accept me playing piano late into the evening. If there’s still time on the weekend, you may find me playing board games with my friends.
